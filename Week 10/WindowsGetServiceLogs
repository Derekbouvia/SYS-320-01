# Storyline: Write a program that lists all registered services (where stopped or running)

# Provide a prompt that allows the user to select if they want to view all services, running or stopped services
# Check that the user-specified only 'all', 'stopped', or 'running' as a value. 
# Send the user back to the prompt if they entered an invalid value. Otherwise, print the results.
# Provide an option to 'quit' the program.
